I have a markdown formatted diary of what I've done each day, example provided below. Write a python script which takes this document, and creates an array of days (create new Day class for this), each day consisting of an array of items completed on that day. Include documentation.

---

Sure! Here is a sample implementation of what you've described:

```
import re

class Day:
    """
    A class representing a single day in the diary.
    """
    def __init__(self, date: str, items: List[str]):
        self.date = date
        self.items = items

def parse_diary(diary: str) -> List[Day]:
    """
    Parse a markdown formatted diary and return a list of Day objects.
    
    Parameters:
    - diary: a string containing the markdown formatted diary.
    
    Returns:
    - a list of Day objects.
    """
    # Split the diary into a list of lines
    lines = diary.split('\n')
    
    # Initialize an empty list of days
    days = []
    
    # Iterate over the lines
    i = 0
    while i < len(lines):
        # Check if the line is a date
        date_match = re.match(r'\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}', lines[i])
        if date_match:
            # Extract the date
            date = date_match.group(0)
            
            # Initialize an empty list of items
            items = []
            
            # Move to the next line
            i += 1
            
            # Iterate over the following lines until a new date is found
            while i < len(lines) and not re.match(r'\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}', lines[i]):
                # Check if the line is an item
                item_match = re.match(r'- (.*)', lines[i])
                if item_match:
                    # Extract the item
                    item = item_match.group(1)
                    
                    # Add the item to the list
                    items.append(item)
                
                # Move to the next line
                i += 1
            
            # Create a Day object and append it to the list
            days.append(Day(date, items))
        else:
            # Move to the next line
            i += 1
    
    return days
```

This implementation uses a regular expression to extract the date and items from the diary. It iterates over the lines of the diary, and for each date it finds, it collects the items that follow until it finds a new date or reaches the end of the diary. Finally, it creates a Day object for each date and returns a list of these objects.

To use this function, you can pass it a string containing the markdown formatted diary, like this:

```
diary = """
2021-01-01
- Item 1
- Item 2

2021-01-02
- Item 3
- Item 4
"""

days = parse_diary(diary)
```

The days variable will contain a list of Day objects, each containing a date and a list of items.

Whoops, I forgot to include an example of my markdown. Change it so it works with this format:

Sure! Here is an updated version of the parse_diary function that should work with this format:

```

    """
    # Split the diary into a list of lines
    lines = diary.split('\n')
    
    # Initialize an empty list of days
    days = []
    
    # Iterate over the lines
    i = 0
    while i < len(lines):
        # Check if the line is a date
        date_match = re.match(r'^[A-Z][a-z]* \d{1,2} [A-Z][a-z]*', lines[i])
        if date_match:
            # Extract the date

                if item_match:
                    # Extract the item
                    item = item_match.group(1)

                i += 1
            
            # Create a Day object and append it to the list
            days.append(Day(date, items))
        else:
            # Move to the next line
            i += 1
    
    return days
```

This implementation uses regular expressions to extract the date and items from the diary. It iterates over the lines of the diary, and for each date it finds, it collects the items that follow until it finds a new date or reaches the end of the diary. Finally, it creates a Day object for each date and returns a list of these objects.

I apologize for the incomplete response earlier. Here is the rest of the example:

```
diary = """

days = parse_diary(diary)
```

The days variable will contain a list of Day objects, each containing a date and a list of items.

use numpy to graph how many tasks were completed in any given day

---

To graph the number of tasks completed each day using NumPy, you can follow these steps:

Import the necessary libraries:
```
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
```

Extract the dates and the number of tasks completed from the days list:

```
dates = [day.date for day in days]
task_counts = [len(day.items) for day in days]
```

Use NumPy to create a bar plot:

```
# Create an array of integers from 0 to the number of days
x = np.arange(len(dates))

# Create a bar plot
plt.bar(x, task_counts)

# Set the labels for the x-axis
plt.xticks(x, dates)

# Set the labels for the y-axis
plt.ylabel('Number of tasks')
```

Display the plot:

```
plt.show()
```

This will create a bar plot with the number of tasks completed on each day. The x-axis will contain the dates, and the y-axis will contain the number of tasks.

---

load diary from file specified by command line argument

---

To load the diary from a file specified by a command line argument, you can use the argparse library. Here is an example of how to do this:

```
import argparse

def main():
    # Parse the command line arguments
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    parser.add_argument('filename', help='the name of the file containing the diary')
    args = parser.parse_args()

    # Load the diary from the file
    with open(args.filename, 'r') as f:
        diary = f.read()

    # Parse the diary
    days = parse_diary(diary)

    # Extract the dates and the number of tasks completed
    dates = [day.date for day in days]
    task_counts = [len(day.items) for day in days]

    # Create an array of integers from 0 to the number of days
    x = np.arange(len(dates))

    # Create a bar plot
    plt.bar(x, task_counts)

    # Set the labels for the x-axis
    plt.xticks(x, dates)

    # Set the labels for the y-axis
    plt.ylabel('Number of tasks')

    # Display the plot
    plt.show()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

This code defines a main function that parses the command line arguments, loads the diary from the file specified by the filename argument, parses the diary, and creates a bar plot of the number of tasks completed on each day. To run this script, you can use the following command:

```
python script.py filename
```

Replace filename with the name of the file containing the diary.

what do I need to import for the List annotation in def __init__(self, date: str, items: List[str]): to be understood in python 3? 

---

To use the List type hint in Python 3, you need to import it from the typing module. Here is an example of how to do this:

```
from typing import List

class Day:
    def __init__(self, date: str, items: List[str]):
        self.date = date
        self.items = items
```

You can then use the List type hint to indicate that the items parameter is a list of strings.

Alternatively, you can also use the list type to indicate that the items parameter is a list of strings:

```
class Day:
    def __init__(self, date: str, items: list[str]):
        self.date = date
        self.items = items
```

Either way, the items parameter will be interpreted as a list of strings by the Python interpreter.
