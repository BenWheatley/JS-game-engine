# Claude Code Rules for this Project

## Git Usage
- This is a git repository - use git for version control
- Do NOT create .backup files - git handles backups
- Use `git diff` or `git status` to check changes if needed

## Testing/Opening Files
- Do NOT use `open "/Users/benwheatley/Documents/Code/JS-game-engine/JS game engine/skeleton.html"`
- That command doesn't work for opening the game in browser
- User will manually open/test the game in their browser when needed
